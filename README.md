# Crosshair App

This is an Overwolf app. Overwolf is a program for Windows that allows you to use apps in an overlay when you are gaming.

This one gives you a crosshair. It used to allow toggling for ADS, but unfortunately the 
methods available were too laggy to be worth it.

The recenter and pixel adjustment buttons only work in game since they are dependant on game window resolution.
Hotkeys (hide/show and close) also only work in game. These can be configured in Overwolf settings.
